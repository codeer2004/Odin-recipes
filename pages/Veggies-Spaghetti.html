                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions for al dente doneness. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water before draining.</li>
                <li>While the pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.

                <li>Add the minced garlic to the pan with the vegetables and cook for another minute until fragrant. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, rosemary, and paprika. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li>Stir in the heavy cream and reserved pasta water to the sauce. Let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens slightly and reaches a creamy consistency. Gently toss the cooked and drained spaghetti into the pan, coating it evenly with the sauce and vegetables.</li>
                <li>Divide the spaghetti mixture among plates. Top each serving with quartered hard-boiled eggs and a sprinkle of additional black pepper, green onion for a touch of visual appeal. Enjoy your delicious and comforting Spaghetti with Cabbage and Creamy Tomato Sauce!</li>
