     <h2><em>Instructions</em></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Cook the penne pasta according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chopped celery and onion, and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chopped mushrooms and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, until they release their moisture.</li>
                <li>To prepare the bechamel sauce, melt the butter in the same pan. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, to form a roux. Slowly whisk in the milk, a little at a time, until fully incorporated and the sauce thickens. Season with black pepper, paprika, ground rosemary, basil, and oregano.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in the grated cheese for the bechamel sauce. Continue stirring until the cheese melts and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the cooked pasta, the vegetable mixture, and the prepared bechamel sauce. Toss everything together until well coated.</li>
                <li>Transfer the mixture to a baking dish suitable for oven use. Sprinkle the top with additional grated cheese for a cheesy crust. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy your creamy and flavorful Bechamel Pasta with Vegetables and Cheese!</li>
